<h1 class="robs">ROBOT'S</h1>
<h2 class="list">What are robot's?</h2>
<div class="what">
<div class="size"><p>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics.<br>
The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics. </p></div>
</div>
<h2 class="list">Why robot's become more important</h2>
<div class="what">
<div class="size"><p>They are used routinely to carry out many tasks that people don’t want to do because such jobs are boring, dirty or dangerous. Robots can also be programmed to carry out some tasks that are too complex for humans. They are broadly classified as industrial and have multiple uses from robots that weld parts on auto assembly lines to robots that interact with humans in the service industry. Though you may not feel like you are dealing with a robot, using the self checkout lane at the grocery store or purchasing tickets from a kiosk at the movies involves interacting with service robots. Robots most obviously impact everyday life in the service capacity.

<h1 class="robs">Top 10 Robots</h1>
<h4 class="list">List</h4>
<ol>

  </ol>

<h2 class="head" id="ia">1. Sophia</h2>
<div class="sophi">

<div class="size"><p>
<em class="hanson">Hanson Robotics</em> most advanced human-like robot, <strong><span>Sophia</span></strong>, personifies our dreams for the future of AI. As a unique combination of science, engineering, and artistry, Sophia is simultaneously a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics, and a platform for advanced robotics and AI research.<br>

The character of Sophia captures the imagination of global audiences. She is the world’s first robot citizen and the first robot Innovation Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. Sophia is now a household name, with appearances on the Tonight Show and Good Morning Britain, in addition to speaking at hundreds of conferences around the world.<br>

Sophia is also a framework for cutting edge robotics and AI research, particularly for understanding human-robot interactions and their potential service and entertainment applications. For example, she has been used for research as part of the Loving AI project, which seeks to understand how robots can adapt to users’ needs through intra and interpersonal development.</p></div>
</div>

<h3 class="can-do">What It Can Do</h3>
<ul class="it-can-do">
<div class="size"><li>Cameras within Sophia's eyes combined with computer algorithms allow her to see.
<li> She can follow faces.
<li>Recognize individuals.
<li>She is able to process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem.
</ul></div>


<h2 class="head" id="ri">2. Kuri<h2>
<div class="sophi">
<img class="robotics-kuri"src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kuri-bot.gif">
<div class="size"><p><strong><span>Kuri</span></strong> is built to connect with you and helps bring technology to life. Kuri can understand context and surroundings, recognize specific people, and respond to questions with facial expressions, head movements, and his unique, lovable sounds. Like many adored robots in popular culture, his personality and ability to connect are his greatest attributes.<br>

“For generations, people have dreamed of having their own personal robot in the home, and we’ve been focused on making that dream more of a reality,” said Sarah Osentoski, COO and co-founder of Mayfield Robotics. “We’re proud to introduce Kuri to the world and can’t wait to see how he touches the lives of everyone, ranging from parents and children to early technology adopters.”</p></div> 
</div>

<h3 class="can-do">What It Can Do</h3>
<ul class="it-can-do">
<div class="size"><li>Capacitive touch sensors let Kuri respond to human touch in a truly personal way. A gentle tap to the head will make Kurt look up at you and chirp affirmingly.
<li>Kuri’s camera is neatly located behind one of his eyes. It can capture 1080p HD pictures and videos in a wide range of lighting conditions. 
<li> Kuri’s head and eye movements look fluid and natural. Her eyes blink, smile, and she can look up, down, and from side to side.
<li>Kuri is equipped with four sensitive microphones that help him precisely locate sounds. That means Kuri can detect your voice and turn his head to face you when you're giving him a voice command.</div>
